Two-point correlation function of shufflings. 
 
"xi-internal-n1/n2/n3.txt" includes shuffling at fixed mass fixed halo internal properties for galaxy density threshold n1/n2/n3.
"xi-env1_..." includes doubly-shuffling results for environment properties (density, alpha, and web type), and "xi-env2_..." includes other env properties (alpha_0.3, alpha_0.55).

The columns in the files are:
1. log r: bin center of seperation in log
2. xi: original clustering of galaxy sample in SAM.
3. xi_shuffle_by_mass: galaxy clustering of sample shuffled by mass.
4-last columne: galaxy clustering of sample shuffled at fixed mass and fixed secondary property.
