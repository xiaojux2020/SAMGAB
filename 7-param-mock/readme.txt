The files in this directory are mock galaxy catalogs created by the 7-parameter model in the paper.

Mock centrals are in files with name "mockcen", and mock satellites are in files with name "mocksat".
Mocks incoporated delta_1.25/delta_5/alpha_0.3_1.25 assembly effect are with the name "g125"/"g5"/"alpha03g125".

The columns inside each file are:
1. fofid: the ID of FOF halo in the N-body simulation.
2. mvir: the host halo virial mass of the mock galaxy in the same unit with the simulation.
3./4./5. x/y/z: position of the mock galaxy in the same unit with the simulation.
