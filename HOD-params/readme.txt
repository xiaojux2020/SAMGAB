The files in this directory are HOD and HOD parameter data in the paper (density threshold n=0.01). 

Halo occupation files have file name "lognc" for centrals and "logns" for satellites. 
For example, "lognc2-48bins_g125.txt" stores central occupation log(N_cen) for each 10% percentile of delta_1.25 in the columns and each halo mass bin in the rows. 
"lognc_ns_all-48bins.txt" includes log(N_cen) and log(N_sat) as function of mass. 
Center of mass bins (logrithmic) can be found in log_mbin.txt.

HOD parameter data for each secondary environmental property are in files with name "pd-cenparam_mstar2...". The 1st column are the rank of the secondary property, and other columns are the HOD parameters.
