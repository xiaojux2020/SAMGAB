# SAMGAB---This data is the underlying data of arXiv2007.05545.

This data is derived based on the Millennium simulation (Springel et al. 2005) and the Guo2011 semi-analytic galaxy formation model (Guo et al. 2011) which are public at:
https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/millennium/

The halo assembly properties in the data are the same as those used in arXiv2007.05545, and other columns (i.e., ID, mass, and positions) are the same as those listed on the 
Millennium simulation webpage: http://gavo.mpa-garching.mpg.de/Millennium/Help/databases/guo2010a/mr
